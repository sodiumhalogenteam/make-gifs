You'll need these two folders (make-gifs/ and make-gifs/done).

Like this folder structure:
-- ~/Desk/make-gifs/ *<-- put your gifs here*
-- ~/Desk/make-gifs/done/ *<-- output will be here*

make any at once gifs with this script

* setup: $ `brew install ffmpeg gifsicle`
* to run: $ `sh make-gifs.sh`
* make a alias for the above into: `makegifs`
